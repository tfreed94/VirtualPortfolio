# Description
I created a responsive webpage to display my portfolio. I have 4 separate pages in my portfolio. A homepage, with buttons to navigate through my site. An about me page, that describes who I am and my goals. A contact information page, that displays my LinkedIn and Github accounts, my mobile phone number, my resume, and my business e-mail. Lastly a work page, that displays my first group project and 2 of my best homework assignments so far in the course.
