For this project I created a virtual portfolio using HTML and CSS. I designed it to show my a picture of me with navigation links in the nav bar so users can easily find the information they're looking for. I created an about me section describing myself with a picture of me. Then I created a section for my future web applications to be placed to display what I have learned during this course. Then I created a contact information section proving my e-mail and phone number. As well as, links to my github and linked pages.
